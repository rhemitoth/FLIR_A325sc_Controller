# ======================== Notes ===========================================

## The intended use of FLIR_A325sc_Controller_Complete.py is automate the control a FLIR A3xx series camera using a raspberry pi.
## Before running this script, you will need to download and install the FLIR Spinnaker SDK for python on your raspberry pi. 
## Additionally, you will need a FLIR A3xx camera, a PIR sensor, a raspberry pi, an waveshare e-ink display hat, and a relay hat for the raspberry pi.
## The relay hat is used to automate the powering on/off of the camera based on input from the PIR sensor.
## When the script is first run, the relay will be switched off and no power will be supplied to the camera.
## After motion is detected by the PIR sensor, the relay is switched on and power is supplied to the camera.
## Once a telnet connection is established between the camera and the pi, the pi sends a signal over telnet to focus the camera.
## Once the camera is focused, a burst of three images are saved at a specified frequency (e.g. every 5 seconds) for a specified durtation (e.g. 5 minutes).
## After images have been collected for a specified duration of time, the relay will be switched off and the camera will power down.
## While the program is running, statements are printed to the e-ink display hat to describe what the system is doing.
## Please consult the README file for a description of how to assemble the system.

# ======================== Connect to Camera and Grab Image ==================================
# The function 'save_images_spinnaker' uses the PySpin library from the FLIR Spinnaker SDK to connect to the camera and grab images
# Argument 'directory' specifies directory on the raspberry pi where the image will be saved 
# Argument 'filetype' specifies filetype of image to be saved ('png', 'jpg', 'tiff', etc). I recommend using tiff since this datatype can easily be converted to a numpy array for analysis in python. 
# Argument 'burst' specifies whether a single image or a burst of images will be saved. The default is burst = True and is ideal for capturing images of free ranging animals.
# Argument 'burst_num' specifies the number of images that are captured as a part of the burst. The default is 3.
